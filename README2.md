### Conclusions and Actions

- Customers with a monthly contract are MUCH more likely to cancel:
    - We can make promotions for the customer to go to the annual contract
    
- Larger families tend to cancel less than smaller families
    - We can make promotions for the person to get an additional phone line
    
- Low Customer Months have A LOT of cancellation. Customers with little time as a customer tend to cancel a lot
    - The customer's first experience with the operator can be bad
    - Maybe the acquisition of customers is bringing in unqualified customers
    - Idea: we can create an incentive for the guy to stay longer as a customer
    
- The more services the guy has, the less chance he will cancel
    - we can do promotions with more services for the customer
    
- There's something in our Fiber service that's making customers cancel
    - Act on the fiber
    
- Customers on the bank slip have a MUCH more chance of canceling, so we have to do some action for them to go to other forms of payment
